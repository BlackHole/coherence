Description: Coherence is a framework written in Python,
        providing a variety of UPnP MediaServer and UPnP MediaRenderer implementations
        for instant use. Furthermore it enables your application to participate in
        digital living networks, at the moment primarily the DLNA/UPnP universe.
        
        Its objective and demand is to relieve your application from all the
        membership/the UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
        
        New in this 0.5.4 - Fools Garden - release
        
        * a DesktopApplet to easily start a Coherence instance from your desktops panel
        Thx to Erwan Velu, Helio Chissini de Castro and Nicolas LÃ©cureuil!
        * more efforts to simplify the ordinary user experience
        * allow now the backend definition via commandline, to just start up
        a MediaServer or anything else, without bothering oneself with the config file
        * specify logfile location and daemonization on the commandline too
        * a bit more usable --help output
        Thx again Erwan Velu!
        * a MediaServer backend for Ampache - a Web-based Audio file manager (http://ampache.org)
        Thx to the awesome help of Karl Vollmer!
        * device implementations for BinaryLight and DimmableLight
        * a little helper to extract device and service xml files and
        send them to us - a beginning of our UPnP device fingerprint program
        * and the usual bugfixes and enhancements
