Description: Coherence is a framework written in Python enabling
        your application to participate in digital living networks, at the moment
        primarily the DLNA/UPnP universe.
        
        Its objective and demand is to relieve your application from all the
        membership/the UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
        
        This 0.4 release brings
        
        * integration of a new logging module
        logging can now be configured via the config file or through an
        environment variable COHERENCE_DEBUG, which overrides the config values.
        
        Usage is like
        COHERENCE_DEBUG=*:3           emit INFO level messages from all modules
        COHERENCE_DEBUG=*:2,ssdp:4    WARNING level messages from all modules,
        plus debug level for the ssdp module
        
        * removed the dependency for SOAPpy, now using own methods and ElementTree only
        * start reworking the client API, to make things there easier too,
        see as an example https://coherence.beebits.net/wiki/CoherenceMediaRenderer
        * serving cover art now to DLNA MediaRenderers
        * refinements on the object creation and the import into the MediaServers
        * an installable package for the Nokia Maemo platform on the N800,
        complete with all dependecies, thanks to Rob Tylor of http://codethink.co.uk
        * and a lot more of the usual bugfixes and enhancements
