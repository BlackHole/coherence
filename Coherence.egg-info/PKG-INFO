Description: Coherence is a framework written in Python,
        providing a variety of UPnP MediaServer and UPnP MediaRenderer implementations
        for instant use. Furthermore it enables your application to participate in
        digital living networks, at the moment primarily the DLNA/UPnP universe.
        
        Its objective and demand is to relieve your application from all the
        membership/the UPnP related tasks as much as possible.
        
        New in this 0.5.2 release
        
        * rework of the XBox 360 support
        * refinements and improvements on the client side API,
        incorporating things we learned on extending the Rhythmbox UPnP plugin
        * some efforts on smoothing the "just use it as
        a MediaServer/-Renderer" user experience
        * rearrangement in the way multiple res elements are ordered,
        fixes issues which we had with some UPnP stacks
        and their 'wayward' interpretation of the specs
        * and a lot more of the usual bugfixes and enhancements
